# How to solve CONFLICTS
A git conflict generates when my local version is different from the on on the
remote repository. It can happen in a collaborative project if two (or more
people) modify the same file in the "same" lines of code. So that, when git is
asked to merge, it does not what version to keep

1 ) $ git pull origin master
# apperance of the conflict

filexx is both modified
The filexx appears modified, Git has modified it with conflict markers

2 ) correct the local version according to your choice and save it. Git is still
in conflict though, I need to commit manually

3) $ git status
4) $ git add filexx
$ git status
5) $ git commit
$ git status
Now it is clear! I can push it!
6) $ git push origin master
